This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this all about
Hello welcome to my ReactJS starter repository. I created this repo for the simple fact that I am tired of deleting the same files and adding the same code just to begin a React project. Now when I want to create a React application all I have to do is clone this repo with the appropriate name that I want in order to be ready to go.

## How do I use this repository
```
git clone 'https://github.com/jasonbharris/my-reactjs-starter.git' yournamehere

```
The above will create a folder with yournamehere and the starter code, then all you have to do is use yarn or npm to initialize the file to bring the files into the project.
